<h1>📊 Analysis: Average Age by Performance Quartile and Role</h1>

<h2>📝 Description</h2>
<p>
This project includes a script that investigates the <strong>average age of employees across performance quartiles</strong>.
The analysis was motivated by a previous finding showing that <strong>Top Talent Account Executives</strong> have an average age of <strong>42 years</strong>.
The objective of this script is to verify whether a similar age pattern is observed across other roles and quartiles.

<h2 id="data-analysis-steps">📈 Data Analysis Steps</h2>
<p>The main steps performed by the script are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Define Your Objective:</strong> Investigate the average age of employees in each performance quartile, based on prior findings where top-performing Account Executives averaged 42 years old.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Ensure the dataset includes <code>employee_id</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>performance_score</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Load the Data:</strong> Import data from an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Handle missing values and validate age and performance score fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Calculate Quartiles:</strong> Segment employees into quartiles based on their performance scores.</li>
  <li><strong>Calculate Average Age:</strong> Group data by quartile and compute the average age for each group.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze Results:</strong> Compare average ages across quartiles, focusing on whether top performers show a similar age trend.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization (Optional):</strong> Create visual charts for age distribution across quartiles.</li>
  <li><strong>Report Findings:</strong> Summarize insights from the analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Make Recommendations:</strong> Provide actionable suggestions for talent management and workforce planning.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ethical-considerations">🧠 Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>
This analysis aims to understand demographic trends related to performance without reinforcing stereotypes or age-related bias.
Age is only one variable among many and should <strong>never</strong> be interpreted as a determinant of talent, potential, or productivity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>🔹 The analysis <strong>does not support discriminatory practices</strong> based on age.</li>
  <li>🔹 Results should be used to <strong>promote inclusion and equitable development opportunities</strong> for all employees.</li>
  <li>🔹 Interpret findings carefully, avoiding assumptions that correlate age directly with performance or capability.</li>
  <li>🔹 Always contextualize data insights within a broader, human-centered understanding of professional experience and diversity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="export-results">📤 Export Results</h2>
<p>The processed data is exported into an Excel file containing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Monthly_Age_Analysis</code> sheet</li>
  <li><code>Overall_Age_Analysis</code> sheet</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mock-example">🧠 Mock Example</h2>
<p>
Below is a simplified example demonstrating how the script processes and outputs results.
The dataset includes <strong>fictional employees</strong> with different roles and performance scores.
</p>

<h3>🧾 Input Example (Mock Dataset)</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>employee_id</th>
    <th>role</th>
    <th>age</th>
    <th>performance_score</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>001</td><td>SDR</td><td>26</td><td>82</td></tr>
  <tr><td>002</td><td>SDR</td><td>29</td><td>74</td></tr>
  <tr><td>003</td><td>EC</td><td>42</td><td>95</td></tr>
  <tr><td>004</td><td>EC</td><td>38</td><td>88</td></tr>
  <tr><td>005</td><td>EV</td><td>33</td><td>91</td></tr>
  <tr><td>006</td><td>EV</td><td>45</td><td>68</td></tr>
  <tr><td>007</td><td>SDR</td><td>23</td><td>60</td></tr>
  <tr><td>008</td><td>EC</td><td>47</td><td>72</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>⚙️ Process</h3>
<p>
The script calculates quartiles based on <code>performance_score</code> and computes the average <code>age</code> per quartile and per role.
</p>

<h3>📊 Mock Output Example</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Quartile</th>
    <th>Average Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>SDR</td><td>Q1</td><td>27.5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SDR</td><td>Q4</td><td>23.0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EC</td><td>Q1</td><td>40.0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EV</td><td>Q1</td><td>33.0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EV</td><td>Q4</td><td>45.0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
From the mock output, we observe that <strong>ECs (Account Executives)</strong> in the top quartile (Q1) indeed show a higher average age, around <strong>40 years</strong>, supporting the earlier finding that Top Talent ECs tend to be more experienced professionals.

## 🔍 Libraries and Metrics Used

This analysis utilizes specific libraries and metrics that are crucial for the efficient execution of the script and the quality of the produced analysis. Below are explanations for the main libraries and metrics used:

| Library/Metric    | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Pandas**        | The Pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis, providing flexible and efficient data structures that make it easier to work with tabular data. It allows for reading Excel files, cleaning data, and performing aggregation operations. |
| **OpenPyXL**      | This library is employed to read and write Excel files (.xlsx). It is essential for exporting the analysis results into an accessible and user-friendly format. |
| **GroupBy**       | The groupby function in Pandas allows for organizing data into groups based on one or more columns. It is essential for calculating averages and counts, such as the average age by quartile and role. |
| **Mean**          | Used to calculate the average ages by quartile, this metric provides a clear and quantitative view of the average age of employees across different performance levels. |
| **Count**         | Counting employees by group (quartile) supplies context about the analyzed sample, allowing for the assessment of the representativeness of the data in average calculations. |

These libraries and metrics were chosen for their robust functionalities and their ability to facilitate complex data analysis clearly and effectively. The combination of them allows for meaningful insights into the relationship between age and employee performance.
